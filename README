Welcome to miauh!

miauh is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals to be created,
accessed, and controlled from a single screen. miauh may be detached from a
screen and continue running in the background, then later reattached.

This release runs on OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Linux, macOS and Solaris.

* Dependencies

miauh depends on libevent 2.x, available from:

	https://github.com/libevent/libevent/releases/latest

It also depends on ncurses, available from:

	https://invisible-mirror.net/archives/ncurses/

To build miauh, a C compiler (for example gcc or clang), make, pkg-config and a
suitable yacc (yacc or bison) are needed.

* Installation

To build and install miauh from a release tarball, use:

	$ ./configure && make
	$ sudo make install

miauh can use the utempter library to update utmp(5), if it is installed - run
configure with --enable-utempter to enable this.

To get and build the latest from version control - note that this requires
autoconf, automake and pkg-config:

	$ git clone https://github.com/tmux/miauh.git
	$ cd miauh
	$ sh autogen.sh
	$ ./configure && make
	$ sudo make install
